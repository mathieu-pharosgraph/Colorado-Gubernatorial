Kaplan is often characterized as a progressive, aligning with the pro-choice movement and backing policies that increase access to reproductive healthcare services, including safe and legal abortion.\n\nIn debates, Kaplan's stance on this issue is often contrasted with more conservative viewpoints. Advocates for Kaplan appreciate his commitment to ensuring access to reproductive health care, including contraception, sex education, and safe abortion services. Critics, particularly those with pro-life views, may argue that Kaplan's stance does not adequately consider the rights of the unborn.\n\nIt's worth noting that Kaplan's position aligns with the majority of New Jersey voters, who tend to lean liberal on social issues. However, his stance could prove polarizing in a general election, where more conservative voters from across the state have a say. \n\nRemember, this portrayal might change depending on the specific stances and actions of Vic Kaplan, as this analysis is purely hypothetical and does not reflect actual data or current events.", "timestamp": 1751537988.976504, "matched_frames_lexical": ["freedom", "accountability"], "matched_frames_lexical_scores": {"freedom": 1, "accountability": 1}, "matched_frames_semantic_scores": {"protectionism": 0.025, "economic growth": 0.046, "corruption": 0.0758, "freedom": 0.2857, "inequality": 0.1816, "security": 0.1446, "trust": 0.1781, "greed": 0.1744, "entitlement": 0.1312, "accountability": 0.2465, "globalism": 0.0459, "national pride": 0.2708}, "matched_moral_foundations_lexical": [], "matched_moral_foundations_lexical_scores": {}, "matched_moral_foundations_semantic_scores": {"care": 0.1585, "harm": 0.0887, "fairness": 0.259, "cheating": 0.0028, "loyalty": 0.0607, "betrayal": 0.1382, "authority": 0.0415, "subversion": 0.208, "sanctity": 0.0753, "degradation": 0.1186}, "positive_frame": "Advocate for women's rights", "negative_frame": "Polarizing on abortion", "framing_polarity_score": 0.3, "framing_role_positive": "Progressive, pro-choice advocate", "framing_role_negative": "Disregards rights of the unborn"}

For example, if he's a Democrat, he might be expected to support more cooperative, multilateral approaches to foreign policy. If he's a Republican, he might be expected to prioritize American interests and security.\n\nIn any case, Kaplan's exact stances on specific foreign policy issues would likely come out in debates, interviews, and policy statements.

Depending on Cedrone's stance, his approach could either resonate with a broad section of voters or alienate those who disagree with him.\n\nUntil Gerardo Cedrone formally announces his candidacy and outlines his policies, it's impossible to provide a more detailed analysis.
